## Hi I am _Moonstone!_  ✨
###### he/him
### I am an indie game developer who loves programming and learning new things about it.

### I use _C# and the MonoGame Framework_ to make my games and other various projects.

I code mostly in C# and it is my favorite programming language. Visual Studio is my IDE of choice. I am interested in trying to make a multiplayer game. I am also working on a custom game engine for my games. I have had to rewrite it 3 times by now lmao.

Currently trying to make the next best game of the year 😎
